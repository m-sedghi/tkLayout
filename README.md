# Description

The **tkLayout-lite** represents a derived SW version of tracker geometry modelling tool and tracker performance analysis tool **tkLayout**, 
which has been fully developed within the CMS collaboration at CERN. Its main aim is to study performance of a new silicon tracker, 
replacing the current one in a view of the Phase-2 upgrade (mid 2020's). In order to utilize such broad functionality of tkLayout SW in 
other experiments, an intensive effort has been made to prepare a ligth version of the original tkLayout tool. 
Its main feature is a full modularity, experiment independence and comprehensive documentation.

The key features of tkLayout may be described as follows: a tracker geometry is generated from a set of simple configuration files (cf. GeometryManager 
& MainConfigHandler), defining the module types, tracker layout and material composition. Various support structures are then automatically added and 
services routed to build a truly realistic tracking system (c.f. Materialway). The tkLayout-lite has been programmed with flexibility in mind to provide natural 
support for various detector geometries and wide spectrum of analyses to be run with given layout and study the best trade-off among many figures of merit, 
such as: tracking resolution, material budget, power dissipation, cost etc. The tkLayout software is easy to be used thanks to its modular structure. The 
individual analysis modules, so-called analyzers, are run sequentially by so-called AnalysisManager, first to analyze the data and then to visualize the 
obtained results in a compact & user-friendly way. The visualization is provided via html format. Several web pages are generated and included on the main 
web-site. They may contain various explanation texts, pictures, graphs, tables etc. (cf. RootWSite, RootWPage). Several important analyzers to be explicite 
mentioned: AnalyzerResolution (track resolution studies, which mathematically make use of a parabolic approximation in a global chi2 fit technique to estimate 
the track parameters cov. matrix; parabolic approx. simplifies a more complex approach to circle fitting in XY; a line is being used to simplify track fitting 
in s-Z), AnalyzerPattern (performing track propagation & estimation of tracker pattern recognition capabilities - makes use of error propagation technique 
applied to a parabolic approximation; to estimate the background level (hits) for given tracker & accelerator a Fluka charged fluence map is assumed to be add 
to tkLayout on the inpute), AnalyzerGeometry reporting details about geometry), AnalyzerMatBudget (reporting tracker material budget) & AnalyzerOccupancy (reporting 
occupancy & date rates being estimated based on built-in geometry & Fluka charged particles fluence provided as an input to tkLayout).   

Developed at CERN by Gabrielle Hugo, Zbynek Drasal, Stefano Martina, Giovanni Bianchi, Nicoletta De Maio. Manager: Stefano Mersi.


# Getting the code

The code is accessible from an official github repository: https://github.com/tkLayout/tkLayout/tree/masterLite (use clone command to make a local copy):

    git clone -b masterLite https://github.com/tkLayout/tkLayout.git
    cd tkLayout


# Before the compilation/run

One needs several libraries to link the tkLayout with: a working version of ROOT (root and root-config should be in user's path) and a few
BOOST libraries:
  * boost_filesystem
  * boost_regex
  * the ROOT library set (follow instructions on https://root.cern.ch)

On Lxplus machine, one needs to run a bash shell and source the following configuration file:

    source setup_centos7.sh


# Compilation/Install

Compilation using cMake:

    mkdir build     (all object files, help files, libs, ... will be kept here)
    cd build
    cmake ..        (generate makefile)
    make install    (or write make all + make install)
    make doc        (generate Doxygen-based documentation in doc directory)

    make uninstall  (if cleaning needed)
    rm *            (clean all content in build directory & restart if needed)

Create first a **build** directory in the tkLayout home directory. All make related content will be then created here. Change the working 
directory to **build** and call **cmake ..** command (directing cMake to the tkLayout uppermost directory such as it reads correctly the 
CMakeLists.txt configuration file). After all MakeFiles are generated by cmake, call **make all** (**make install**) to compile tkLayout. 
Optional **install** copies the executables into tkLayout/bin directory and creates symlinks in ${HOME}/bin directory. To revert this 
procedure, apply **uninstall** option. 

Obviously, make sure you will use the executable which you just created in ${HOME}/bin:

    which tklayout


# Documentation
Doxygen documentation is generated using **make doc**, and all the generated html files are saved in tkLayout/doc/html directory.


# First-time install
If this is the first time that you install tkLayout, a few questions will be asked and a tkLayout configuration
file will be created in $HOME/.tkgeometry:

1. One needs to provide the destination directory for the www output of the program (proabably
  something like /afs/cern.ch/user/y/yourname/www/layouts) this directory needs to be writable by you
  and readable by the web server.
     The style files will be copied during the installation to that directory (for example
  /afs/cern.ch/user/y/yourname/www/layouts/style ). If the style files get changed during the development
  a new ./install.sh will be needed to get this propagated to the output.
     Alternatively, one can choose to make a symbolic link between the source directory style directory and
  the layout directory. This avoids the need of repeating the ./install.sh at every update of the style files
  but in order to do this the source directory should also be within the reach of the web server.
2. The set of momentum values to be used for the simulation
3. Project name
4. Author of generated results


# Run
Run tklayout on a test-study FCC design:

    cd tkLayout/geometries
    tklayout FCC/FCChh_Option4.cfg --geometry --material
    

# Command line options

You should want to get more options / tune number of tracks used for analysis.
Have a look at:

     tklayout --help


# Have fun!
Of course, there would be a lot of developments / debug / design work to do :) 
The present design study with FCChh_Option4.cfg has been done by Zbynek Drasal.
